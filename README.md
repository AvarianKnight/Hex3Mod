# Hex3Mod

Adds 5 new items to the game:
* 3 Common
* 2 Uncommon

Each item has a unique effect and configurable values. Special thanks to the RoR2 Modding Discord for teaching me how to do this.

I'm new to both coding and  using Github, so forgive the rookie mistakes (but please report them)

# To do:

* Create more items
* Improve 3d modelling for the items
* Assess balance and bugginess
* Ensure mod compatibility

# Bugs

* They are inevitable, but I'll try to fix them as soon as I can. Please give feedback/bug reports on Discord: hex3#7952
