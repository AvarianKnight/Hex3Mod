Each item has a unique effect and configurable values. Special thanks to the RoR2 Modding Discord for teaching me how to do this.

# To do:

* Create more items
* Improve and retouch VFX
* Assess balance and bugginess
* Ensure mod compatibility

# Bugs

* They are inevitable, but I'll try to fix them as soon as I can. Please give feedback/bug reports on Discord: hex3#7952
