<summary>Earlier updates</summary>

### 1.1.1
* Fixed an issue where some enemies were untargetable by Huntress

### 1.1.0 - Due to the many changes, deleting or modifying your config file will be necessary.
A lot of the mechanics in the mod felt too convoluted, and some just didn't feel good to play. In this update I hope to revamp the items in a way that keeps their original purpose, but makes them more consistent and useful. Let me know how I've done!
